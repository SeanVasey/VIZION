[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — refreshed app icon & glyph

- **New master brand artwork.** Replaced both source SVGs in `public/brand/` with
  improved designs: `vizion-icon-token.svg` is now a glossy black squircle with a
  lime-green glowing border framing the aperture glyph, and `vizion-mark-token.svg`
  is the refined glyph alone (chrome parentheses around a neon bar, chevron and
  split ring, with dot accents and lens flares) on a transparent ground.
- **Whole matrix re-derived.** Ran `npm run generate:icons` so all 32 outputs —
  the transparent `any` PWA icons, maskable tiles, `apple-touch-icon`, favicons,
  iOS splashes, and the App Router `icon.svg`/`icon.png`/`apple-icon.png` — now
  reflect the new design. The iOS Add-to-Home-Screen tile and PWA install icon
  pick up the new look with no further changes.
- **Login hero sized to the glyph.** `AuthHero` now renders the wide glyph
  (1872×1084) at its native aspect ratio instead of forcing a 150×150 square.

### Fixed — avatar, composer & ambient polish

- **Profile avatar now renders.** Root cause was the Tailwind config defining
  `theme.spacing` at the top level, which *replaced* the scale and pruned
  `h-24`/`w-24` (and `h-11`, `h-9`, every fractional step) — so the 96px avatar
  button generated no size and collapsed to a dot. Moved the var-based 8-pt keys
  into `theme.extend.spacing` (identical px values) to restore the full scale.
  Additionally allowed the OAuth avatar CDNs (`lh3.googleusercontent.com`,
  `avatars.githubusercontent.com`) in both the CSP `img-src` and next/image
  `remotePatterns`, and added a name-monogram fallback with `onError` recovery so
  an expired provider URL no longer leaves an empty circle.

### Changed — integrated composer & ambient glow

- **Unified Enhance composer.** The target-model picker is nested into the
  composer's rounded top rail (as an `appearance-none` dropdown with a chevron),
  and a reset (↺) control plus the **► ENHANCE** action sit in the rounded bottom
  rail beside the token/media readouts — so every control lives inside one
  rounded-rectangle surface, with a Laser `focus-within` edge-glow.
- **Ambient aurora behind translucent chrome.** Added drifting Laser glow blooms
  (CSS, paused under reduced-motion) to the neural-mesh background and a new
  `--chrome` token + `.glass-chrome` so the header and bottom nav are more
  translucent and reveal the glow beneath. Canvas specks are slightly brighter
  with a soft halo on the Laser nodes.

### Fixed — UI remediation (R1–R8): restore the locked VIZION spec

- **Brand wiring (R1):** the squircle `vizion-icon-token.svg` now sits left of the
  wordmark in the top bar; the transparent `vizion-mark-token.svg` is the centered
  login hero. New `BrandPills` (VASEY/AI + live `v{version}` read from
  `package.json` via `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`, never hardcoded).
- **Type system (R2):** Bebas Neue / Reddit Sans / JetBrains Mono are now
  self-hosted via `next/font/local` (vendored OFL woff2 in `src/app/fonts/`).
  JetBrains Mono is scoped to the enhanced-prompt **output/result region only**;
  every other surface — including the prompt input editor — is Reddit Sans
  (guarded by `tests/unit/type-scoping.test.ts`). The wordmark is now plain
  `VIZION` (IO in accent), with the bracket/chevron motif left to the mark/icon.
- **Light/dark & contrast (R3):** role-mapped tokens for both themes;
  `--chalk`/`--silver` swap per theme. Added `--on-laser` (constant dark ink on
  laser fills) and theme-aware `--accent-ink`/light `--flare` so laser/error are
  never used as low-contrast text on light. Every text/bg pair passes WCAG AA in
  both themes.
- **Glass + background (R4):** an ambient neural-mesh `<canvas>`
  (`NeuralMeshBackground`) decoupled from React, capped ~30fps, particle count
  scaled to viewport, fully paused on `document.hidden`, with a static-gradient
  fallback under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Glass stays on floating elements only;
  the active result surface gets a top-edge laser shimmer.
- **Mode instrument & balance (R5):** the five modes are now one glass chassis
  (`ModeRig`) with a sliding laser lens-lock indicator, symmetric at 360/390/430px.
  The target-model picker is a centered content-width pill; full width is reserved
  for the Enhance CTA and the mode grid. Unified `.btn-laser`/`.btn-secondary`/
  `.btn-destructive` system.
- **Auth & profile (R6):** branded OAuth marks (multicolor Google G, theme-aware
  GitHub) via `ProviderIcon`, capped/centered. The profile shows the auth provider
  as its branded mark ("Connected with GitHub"); sign-out is a capped destructive
  button.
- **Footer (R7):** canonical `Footer` on login + profile — "VASEY/AI Presents" /
  Vasey Multimedia, dynamic year, version pill, safe-area aware. VM + V/AI
  monograms render behind `BRAND_MONOGRAMS_READY` (typographic fallback until
  Sean's real files land) with `filter:invert(1)` theming.
- **iOS & performance (R8):** library rows memoized; the media studio is a
  route-level dynamic import; the result tree reads the *submitted* input so typing
  never re-renders it; canvas paused offscreen.

### Changed — Brand icons

- Replaced the placeholder aperture glyph across the full icon/splash matrix with
  the master brand artwork. Two hand-authored SVGs now live in `public/brand/`:
  `vizion-icon-token.svg` (the branded Void plate + glow border) and
  `vizion-mark-token.svg` (the aperture mark on a transparent ground).
- `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` now rasterizes those master SVGs instead of the
  removed `scripts/lib/glyph.mjs` placeholder builder: the transparent "any"
  matrix and iOS splashes use the mark; apple-touch, favicons, and the App
  Router `icon.png`/`apple-icon.png` use the opaque plate; maskable tiles center
  the mark in the safe zone on a full-bleed Void canvas.
- Added `src/app/icon.svg` (the master tile) so modern browsers get a scalable
  favicon, with `icon.png` as the raster fallback.

### Added — v1.0 Hardening (P6)

- **Content-Security-Policy** + the full security-header set in `next.config.ts`
  (`default-src 'self'`, Supabase-scoped `connect/img/media`, `frame-ancestors`/
  `object-src`/`base-uri` locked; HSTS, nosniff, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`).
- **Rate limit on every model route**: an in-memory burst limiter
  (`src/lib/security/rate-limit.ts`) layered in front of the DB cost/rate cap.
- **iOS storage-eviction recovery**: an IndexedDB **offline outbox**
  (`src/lib/pwa/outbox.ts`) that queues failed mutations (e.g. Save) and replays
  them via `OutboxFlusher` on `online` / `visibilitychange` (no Background Sync
  on iOS); `navigator.storage.persist()` requested on SW registration.
- **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**: skip-to-content link, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  handling, focusable main landmark; existing visible focus ring + labels.
- Security/hardening checklist + backup-restore runbook (`docs/runbooks/hardening.md`).
- Tests: rate-limiter + outbox-flush (unit); CSP header + skip link (e2e).

### Added — v0.5 Media prompts (P5)

- `MediaAsset` is first-class (A5): a `media_assets` table (RLS owner-only from
  creation) + a private `media` Storage bucket with owner-scoped policies.
- Attach an image / video / audio reference in the Enhance studio; it uploads to
  the owner's prefix and records the asset.
- **Extraction pipeline behind a flag** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_EXTRACTION`, default
  `proxy`): vision via the model proxy (`/api/media`, Anthropic, cost-capped) with
  an **on-device fallback** (canvas palette + dimensions, audio duration) — the
  locked open question resolved as *proxy + on-device fallback*.
- **Generation-syntax formatters** (pure, unit-tested): Midjourney image-ref
  (`--ar/--v/--iw`), Runway/Sora/Kling motion phrasing, and an audio spec — fold
  the detected attributes into a generation-ready prompt that can be copied/saved.
- Storage budget with an **Amber** warning near quota (50 MB).

### Added — v0.4 Library & versioning (P4)

- Schema (RLS owner-only from creation): `prompts`, immutable `prompt_versions`
  (no update/delete policy → snapshots), and `activity_events`. `Prompt.current_ver`
  points at the active version; versions chain via `parent_ver`.
- Save flow: an enhancement saves a `Prompt` + first `PromptVersion`
  (Save-to-library on the diff). Revise → re-enhance → append a new version.
- Prompt detail (`/library/[id]`): version history, **diff any two versions**
  (reusing the word-diff), one-tap **restore** (sets `current_ver`), and delete.
- Library browser: search + tag + model filter over saved prompts; the **activity
  feed** (created · enhanced · saved · shared · restored) tied to the profile.
- Pure helpers (`deriveTitle`, `parseTags`, `filterPrompts`, `relativeTime`) with
  unit tests.

### Added — v0.3 Enhance core (P3)

- Provider adapter (`enhance(input, mode, target)`) fanning out to per-target
  implementations: Anthropic/Opus (official SDK), OpenAI/GPT (SDK), Google/Gemini
  (REST). Model strings are env-overridable config (D9); keys are server-side only.
- Per-target idiomatic formatters (Opus XML/CoT · GPT roles/JSON · Gemini
  parts/system-instruction) and the five modes (clarify · expand · condense ·
  reformat · target).
- `/api/enhance` route: auth-required, with a per-user **rate limit + daily cost
  cap** enforced server-side before any model call (backed by a `usage_events`
  ledger with RLS + a `usage_window` aggregate).
- The **transformation diff** — input on the Void end, enhanced output on the
  Chalk end, changed tokens lit in Laser, with a plain-language rationale —
  plus copy / share / export (Markdown · JSON · text) and an Amber cap warning.
- Tests: word-diff, formatters/parse, cost + exporters (unit); enhance-API 401
  (e2e). Pure word-level LCS diff lives in `src/lib/enhance/diff.ts`.

### Added — v0.2 Auth & profile (P2)

- Supabase Auth wired end-to-end: magic link + GitHub + Google on the sign-in gate, with
  OAuth/PKCE (`/auth/callback`) and email-OTP (`/auth/confirm`) route handlers and
  sign-out.
- Session middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) refreshes the JWT and gates every route to the
  sign-in page when signed out (server is the source of truth).
- Database (applied to the live project): `profiles` + `oauth_identities` with **RLS
  owner-only policies from creation**, an auto-profile trigger on signup, an `updated_at`
  trigger, and a `password_set` flag. Security advisors: clean.
- Avatars: Supabase Storage bucket (public read, owner-scoped writes) + a dependency-free
  client-side square→circular **avatar cropper**.
- Profile screen with real data — editable full name, display name, email (re-verify),
  default model, and theme; preferences sync to the account and hydrate on load.
- Magic-link → set-password onboarding (D15/A4), enforced by the `(app)` layout.
- Routes reorganised into an authenticated `(app)` group; offline shell decoupled from
  auth (static `offline.html` fallback). Tests: onboarding gate (unit), auth-gate +
  PWA/offline (e2e). Docs: `docs/runbooks/auth-setup.md`.

### Added — v0.1 Shell (Phase 0 + P1)

- Repo scaffold: Standard `CLAUDE.md` v2.0, configs (TypeScript strict, Tailwind +
  CSS-var tokens, ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig), `.env.example` (keys only),
  `SECURITY.md`, `docs/` (architecture + decision log + runbook), `tasks/lessons.md`,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint · typecheck · test · build · npm audit).
- Design tokens: the seven locked roles + Amber, with dark/light/system theming.
- Typography via `next/font` — Bebas Neue (display) · Reddit Sans (body) · JetBrains
  Mono (utility).
- PWA shell: `manifest.webmanifest` (`any` + `maskable`, transparent-PNG matrix),
  hand-authored Workbox service worker (SWR shell · network-first enhance/auth ·
  cache-fallback library) with an offline fallback, iOS splash placeholders.
- Safe-area **v2 luminance-polarity template** wiring status-bar tint + nav contrast.
- 3-tab bottom nav (Enhance · Library · Profile) and the Enhance composer shell
  (mode chips · mono editor · target club rack · ENHANCE CTA).
- Auth gate stub (brand + value prop + three method buttons; Supabase wiring in P2).
- Tests: Vitest unit (safe-area math, contrast guardrails, UI store) and Playwright
  e2e (shell render, nav, theme, manifest, SW, offline shell).
